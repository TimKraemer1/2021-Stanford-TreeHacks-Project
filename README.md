# 2021-Stanford-TreeHacks-Project
Data analysis tool to compare and plot public Twitter sentiment data for a specific company to its market performance.

We were able to identify a correlation between the tweet sentimentality and the company stock performance ~50% of the time.

We programmed it in Python using VADER for sentiment analysis, Pandas and CSV Reader for data scraping and presentation, and public databases provided by Kaggle.

Although this project did not win any competitions at the Stanford Hackathon, it did teach me alot about data manipulation, display, and reading with Python. It also introduced me to different new Python libraries and frameworks, such as VADER.

TO USE:

The .CSV files that are required for this project are too large to push onto github, so I provided a link to a Google Drive Folder that contains all of the required .CSV files:
